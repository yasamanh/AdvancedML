    "\n",
    "#### Decision Trees\n",
    "Increasing `max_features` and `max_depth` and decreasing `min_samples_split` and `min_samples_leaf` tend to build more complex models (increase Variance and reduce Bias).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extremely Random Forests\n",
    "The variance between different trees tends to cancel each other while the biases reinforce each other. That is, because the trees are different, they tend to overfit in different ways but when they underfit, they underfit the same way. So you want to use higher variance, lower bias parameters than you would with a decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient Boosting Trees\n",
    "Increasing the learning rate increases variance. Decreasing the fraction subsampled and the max features will decrease the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Questions\n",
    "1. Decision Trees are clearly the least accurate although possibly the most explicable and they train quickly.  (Extra) Random Forests are more expensive to train but can be trained in parallel -- both across processors on the same data in one machine and across machines by splitting up the sample data.  Gradient Boosting Trees are not as naturally parallelizable and (empirically) seem to be the slowest. Also see the [algorithm comparison notebook](AM_Comparing_ML_Algorithms.ipynb).\n",
    "2. Pros and cons can be found [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#decision-trees)."
