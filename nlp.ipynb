    "1. [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is able to read JSON text directly.  Use the `read_json()` function with the `lines=True` keyword argument.  While the rest of this notebook will assume you are using a list of dictionaries, you can complete it with dataframes, if you so desire. Some of the example code will need to be modified in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are obvious miscodings in the data.  There is no need to try to correct them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building models\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first three questions, you will need to build and train an estimator to predict the star rating from the text of a review.  We recommend building a pipeline out of transformers and estimators provided by Scikit Learn.  You can decide whether these pipelines should take full review objects or just their text as input to the `fit()` and `predict()` methods, but it does pay to be consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find it useful to serialize the trained models to disk.  This will allow you to reload the models after restarting the notebook, without needing to retrain them.  We recommend using the [`dill` library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dill) for this (although the [`joblib` library](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html) also works).  Use\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dill.dump(estimator, open('estimator.dill', 'w'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "to serialize the object `estimator` to the file `estimator.dill`.  If you have trouble with this, try setting the `recurse=True` keyword args in the call of `dill.dump()`.  The estimator can be deserialized with\n",
    "```python\n",
    "estimator = dill.load(open('estimator.dill', 'r'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may run into trouble with the size of your models and Digital Ocean's memory limit. This is a major concern in real-world applications. Your production environment will likely not be that different from Digital Ocean and being able to deploy there is important. Think about what information the different stages of\n",
    "your pipeline need and how you can reduce the memory footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you may notice that your serialized models are very large and take a long time to load.  Some hints to reduce their size:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are using `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal values of hyperparameters (and you should be), the resultant object will contain many copies of the estimator that aren't needed any more.  Instead of serializing the whole `GridSearchCV`, serialize just the estimator with the correct hyperparameters.  This can be accessed through the `.best_estimator_` attribute of the `GridSearchCV` object.  Alternatively, the `.best_params_` attribute gives the best values of the hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `CountVectorizer` keeps track of all words that were excluded from vectorization in its `.stop_words_` attribute.  This can be interesting to examine, but isn't needed for predictions.  Set this attribute to the empty list before serializing it to save disk space."

    "Each of the \"model\" questions asks you to create a function that models the number of stars given in a review from the review text.  It will be passed a list of dictionaries.  Each of these will have the same format as the JSON objects you've just read in.  This function should return a list of numbers of the same length, giving the predicted star ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is passed to the `score()` function, which will receive input from the grader, run your function with that input, report the results back to the grader, and print out the score the grader returned.  Depending on how you constructed your estimator, you may be able to pass the predict method directly to the `score()` function.  If not, you will need to write a small wrapper function to mediate the data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## bag_of_words_model\n",
    "Build a linear model predicting the star rating based on the count of the words in each document (bag-of-words model).  Use a [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer) or [HashingVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer) to produce a feature matrix giving the counts of each word in each review.  Feed this in to linear model, such as `Ridge` or `SGDRegressor`, to predict the number of stars from each review.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "1. Don't forget to use tokenization!  This is important for good performance but it is also the most expensive step.  Try vectorizing as a first initial step and then running grid-serach and cross-validation only on of this pre-processed data.  `CountVectorizer` has to memorize the mapping between words and the index to which it is assigned.  This is linear in the size of the vocabulary.  The `HashingVectorizer` does not have to remember this mapping and will lead to much smaller models.\n",
    "\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    " text = [row['text'] for row in data]\n",
    " X = CountVectorizer().fit_transform(text)\n",
    "\n",
    " # Now, this can be run with many different parameters\n",
    " # without needing to retrain the vectorizer:\n",
    " model.fit(X, stars, hyperparameter=something)\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try choosing different values for `min_df` (minimum document frequency cutoff) and `max_df` in `CountVectorizer`.  Setting `min_df` to zero admits rare words which might only appear once in the entire corpus.  This is both prone to overfitting and makes your data unmanageably large.  Don't forget to use cross-validation or to select the right value.  Notice that `HashingVectorizer` doesn't support `min_df`  and `max_df`.  However, it's not hard to roll your own transformer that solves for these.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try using [LinearRegression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression) or [RidgeCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV.html#sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV).  If the memory footprint is too big, try switching to [Stochastic Gradient Descent](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html#sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor) You might find that even ordinary linear regression fails due to the data size.  Don't forget to use [GridSearchCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) to determine the regularization parameter!  How do the regularization parameter `alpha` and the values of `min_df` and `max_df` from `CountVectorizer` change the answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will likely pick up several hyperparameters between the tokenization step and the regularization of the estimator.  While is is more strictly correct to do a grid search over all of them at once, this can take a long time. Quite often, doing a grid search over a single hyperparameter at a time can produce similar results.  Alternatively, the grid search may be done over a smaller subset of the data, as long as it is representative of the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, assemble a pipeline that will transform the data from records all the way to predictions.  This will allow you to submit its predict method to the grader for scoring."

Let's say you're training a model to extract image captions from websites and return a list of names that were in the caption. Your overall accuracy at some point reaches 70%. You can try manually giving the model what you know are the correct image captions from the training set, and see how the accuracy improves (maybe up to 75%). Alternatively, giving the model the perfect name parsing for each caption increases accuracy to 90%. This indicates that the name parsing is a much more promising target for further work, and the caption extraction is a relatively smaller factor in the overall performance.\n",

    "If you don't know the right answers at different stages of the pipeline, you can still evaluate how important different parts of the model are to its performance by changing or removing certain steps while keeping everything else constant. You might try this kind of analysis to determine how important adding stopwords and stemming to your NLP model actually is, and how that importance changes with parameters like the number of features."

We can think of the corpus as defining an empirical distribution over all ngrams.  We can find word pairs that are unlikely to occur consecutively based on the underlying probability of their words. Mathematically, if $p(w)$ be the probability of a word $w$ and $p(w_1 w_2)$ is the probability of the bigram $w_1 w_2$, then we want to look at word pairs $w_1 w_2$ where the statistic\n",

    "\n",
    "Estimating the probabilities is simply a matter of counting, and there are number of approaches that will work.  One is to use one of the tokenizers to count up how many times each word and each bigram appears in each review, and then sum those up over all reviews.  You might want to know that te `CountVectorizer` has a `.get_feature_names()` method which gives the string associated with each column.  (Question for thought: Why doesn't the `HashingVectorizer` have a similar method?)\n",

    "1. How does changing this smoothing parameter affect the word pairs you get qualitatively?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can interpret the smoothing parameter as adding a constant number of occurrences of each word to our distribution.  Does this help you determine set a reasonable value for this 'prior factor'?\n",

    "The reference solution is not an aggressive filterer: it errors in favor of leaving apparently nonsensical words. On further consideration, many of these are actually somewhat meaningful. The smoothing parameter chosen in the reference solution is equivalent to giving each word 90 previous appearances prior to considering this data.  This was chosen by generating a list of bigrams for a range of smoothing parameters and seeing how many of the bigrams were shared between neighboring values.  When the shared fraction reached 95%, we judged the solution to have converged.  Note that `min_df` should not be set too high, where it could exclude these borderline words."
